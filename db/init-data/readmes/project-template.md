### Code Reviews and Feedback

Remember, the absolute, tip-top, #1 priority is asking for and receiving feedback on your code. It's better to "fall short" of an iteration and ask for feedback on an incomplete version than it is to get stuck. It's better to ask for feedback on a hacked-together-but-working version than worry about whether it's "polished enough."

Indeed, even if you know your code is unpolished or incomplete, you may as well ask for feedback so that we can be working on that feedback in parallel while you're polishing or completing your code. The worst that could possibly happen is that we give you feedback you are already aware of.

## Releases

Each release is made of individual features. For each feature, create a [branch and pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#initiating-the-pull-request).

When you submit the pull request, *make sure you [submit the pull request against your fork*](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository).

Github will default to submitting the pull request against the Codeunion master repository.

Submit each pull request as a request for feedback. You may merge them into your fork immediately; or wait for feedback.

Each feature should take between 30 minutes to 3 hours to complete.
