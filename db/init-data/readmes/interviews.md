# Interviews

A repository for files, information, and other miscellany for running and organizing student interviews.

Please, commit **only** files that an interviewer might need to run an interview, e.g., files for technical interviews, relevant questions to ask, links to important documents and forms, and so on.

Do *not* commit things like interview notes.
