## Ruby Exercises

Here at [CodeUnion][codeunion] we believe that one of the best ways to develop skills as a programmer is to write code and get feedback on your code in the form of a [code review][code review] from a more experienced programmer.  We wrote these exercises with the intent to give you the opportunity to solve some fun programming challenges and then submit your solutions to us for code review. [Click here to see an example code review][example code review].
