# Rails Project Ideas

This repository contains a list of project ideas for various web applications. Each idea is outlined in a single markdown file.

## MVP vs. Other Iterations

Each project consists of an MVP plus a handful of additional feature ideas.  Each part is only a suggestion, although the MVP is meant to be the bare essential set of features you'll need.  Dividing the projects like this is meant to increase the likelihood your final version is successful â€” consider it a little dash of product management.
