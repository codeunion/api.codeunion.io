How We Teach at CodeUnion

## Style Guide
This style guide uses the key words "_must_", "_must not_", "_required_",
"_shall_", "_shall not_", "_should_", "_should not_", "_recommended_", "_not
recommended_", "_may_", and "_optional_". These _should_ be interpreted as
defined in [RFC 2119](http://microformats.org/wiki/rfc-2119)



### Pedagogical Style
Curriculum _should_ be welcoming, precise, and terse; prioritized in that order.
This is very hard to balance; so good luck.

Curriculum _should_ avoid addressing the reader as "you", and instead opt for
"we". This is intended to encourage a sense of community and that the teachers
and students are in this together.

Curriculum _should not_ claim things are easy. This can discourage the readers
growth mindset

Curriculum _should not_ use words like "just" or "simply" or similar. This can
discourage the readers growth mindset.

Curriculum _must_ use the gender-neutral pronouns such as "one" or "they" or
"theirs" in place of gendered pronouns such as  "he" or "her" or "his"; except
in cases where ones gender is explicitly known.
