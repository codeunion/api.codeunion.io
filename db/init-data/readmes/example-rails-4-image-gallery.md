A multi-user photo upload site built in rails.

## Demonstration Objectives
This example is intended to demonstrate:

1. Making small, purposeful commits
2. Using feature-tests to shape your codebase
3. Regular refactoring to the [4 rules of simple
   design](http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design)
   (Taken a bit to an extreme)

## Releases
Each feature is linked to a pull request which adds the feature. Every commit
explains my reasoning in (some level of) detail. I'd recommend reading the pull
requests oldest to newest, commit by commit, both messages and code.
